## Superpowers by Jesse Vincent

Several feather-flow skills are derived from or inspired by [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by Jesse Vincent, licensed under MIT (v4.1.1).

### Directly Derived (>80% content match)

| Feather Skill | Superpowers Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `feather:finish` | `finishing-a-development-branch` | Near-verbatim port + verification gate |
| `feather:write-tests` | `test-driven-development` | Verbatim + database mutation examples |

### Heavily Derived (50-80%)

| Feather Skill | Superpowers Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `feather:execute` | `executing-plans` | Core workflow + subagent review gates |
| `feather:create-plan` | `writing-plans` | Refocused on behavioral specs (no code) |

### Inspired By (20-50%)

| Feather Skill | Superpowers Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `feather:work-slice` | `subagent-driven-development` | Reimagined as executable TDD enforcement |
| `feather:isolate-work` | `using-git-worktrees` | Extended with branch-only option |
| `feather:verify` | `verification-before-completion` | Structured as Checkpoint 2 + feedback |

### Conceptual Successors

| Feather Skill | Superpowers Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `feather:help` | `using-superpowers` | New architecture, shared philosophy |
| `feather:workflow` | `using-superpowers` | New architecture, shared philosophy |
